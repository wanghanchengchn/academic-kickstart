Hello, my name is Hancheng Wang (王瀚橙). I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/">Guihai Chen</a> and <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/">Haipeng Dai</a>. My research interests include data mining and parallel computing.

Currently, I am working on improving the performance of cuckoo filter.
